Web Development.
### Idea :
The thought that went into this project is about developing an application which creates an engaging platform for public to join an Epic Revolution of our cities. It's about bringing the public and the Municipal Corporation closer, which can improve the way day-to-day issues of our localities are resolved. 

### Achievements :
On this very platform, people can post about the issues in their localities. Users's post upon authentication by help of nearby public's reaction (who react with a thumbs-up if the issue exists) to the post, the issue is sent to the relevant Municipal Corporation department and the issues are resolved. The Municipal Corporation can then set the status of the issue. The status of the issue posted can be seen by the user. The issues posted can be reviewed later. Currently we have included just 5 cities.

We also hope to make further increments to our project to add functionalities that will help in this Epic Revolution of our Cities and faster developmemt of our nation!
